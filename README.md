## About

Nekroshell is a highly customizable and feature-rich shell for Linux, built on top of **[quickshell](https://quickshell.outfoxxed.me)**. It is a fork of the beautiful **[caelestia-shell](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell)**, with numerous enhancements and new features.

This project is currently in **beta**, and while it is usable, some features may be incomplete or buggy. It is designed to work on **Arch Linux with Hyprland or Niri**, but we plan to expand compatibility to other distributions and window managers in the future.

## Features

Nekroshell comes with a wide range of features, including:

*   **Customizable Bar:** A sleek and modern bar with widgets for workspaces, clock, system tray, and more.
*   **Interactive Dashboard:** A beautiful dashboard with widgets for date, time, media controls, system resources, and weather.
*   **Powerful Launcher:** An application launcher with fuzzy search and customizable actions.
*   **Stunning Lockscreen:** A secure and visually appealing lockscreen.
*   **Rich Notifications:** A notification system that is both beautiful and functional.
*   **Modular Design:** The shell is built with a modular architecture, making it easy to customize and extend.
*   **And much more!** New features are constantly being added.

## How it Works

Nekroshell is written in **QML**, a declarative language for creating user interfaces. It runs on top of **quickshell**, a lightweight and fast QML shell environment.

The shell is composed of several modules, each responsible for a specific part of the user interface (e.g., bar, dashboard, launcher). These modules can be configured and customized through the QML files in the `config` directory.
